# NGS2-Black
MOD PAGE: https://www.nexusmods.com/ninjagaidenmastercollection/mods/37

This mod attempts to fix questionable and undesirable changes made to NGS2. Includes 4 difficulty modes and a whole host of optional setting toggles.

This mod does restores aspects of NG2 Vanilla but is not a 1:1 mimic.

Lastly, this mod was designed in Master Ninja mode and is geared towards experienced and veteran players

*GAMEPASS VERSION IS NOT SUPPORTED CURRENTLY BUT AM IN THE PROGRESS OF PORTING THE MOD OVER*

Your game must have the latest patch (1.0.0.2) and the North American version. If not, you can replace the .exe with one from the NA version.

If you would like to install blood (credit Kamen Kaizer), remove bloom, and hide the bow on Ryu's back, download the databin file here:https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Vma3lmP9FMZx6vGz_IMg6BNskx3VRK-x

It is highly recommended to download the databin as it assists with the chapter 2 night mod!!

The mod comes with 5 difficulties with HARD being the default.

As of V167 - the desired difficulty mod in the CT must be activated before loading into a level (I.E main menu). 

The toggle to change IS spam behavior and make it closer to NG2 will appear after the difficulty mod has been activated. Once it appears, simply set the value to 1 to activate*

The difficulty mods only works for Master Ninja. If you don't have Master Ninja unlocked, activate the mod first then select any difficulty in game. The mod will automatically force the game to Master Ninja mode.

Difficulty Rating

NGS2 Black - Normal = Mentor

NGS2 Black - Hard = Master Ninja

NGS2 Black - Very Hard = Master Ninja+

NGS2 Black - Master Ninja = Master Ninja++

NGS2 Black - Master Ninja PLUS = Master Ninja++++

NGS2 Black - Ultimate Ninja = Master Ninja++++++

Need help deciding? My recommendation (subjective!)

Pro = Master Ninja PLUS / Ultimate 
Veteran = Very Hard / Master Ninja
Experienced = Hard
Casual = Normal 

Very Hard to Ultimate Ninja for the most part have the same enemy spawn setup and numbers aside from a couple of sections. The difficulty increase comes from the custom A.I aggro system cooldown timer window lowering the high up the difficulty you go, damage received increase, increased chance of some bosses special moves activating more often, and some enemies/bosses moves activating only on the higher difficulties.

Also included are some "fun" toggles

1. No clip
2. Electric effect on hit
3. Disable delimb (enemy limbs won't pop off)
4. Modify image size
5. Disable rain effect in chapter 3

Most aspects of the mod can be individually turned off. All instructions are laid out in the CT file.

There is one section in chapter 14 and Chapter 17 where ninpo is disabled, this is not a bug and is intentional (ULTIMATE NINJA ONLY)

Known Bugs:

1.  Turning off the difficulty mod in-level and then opening the weapon menu with no difficulty mod turned on has a chance of crashing the game.
2. Small chance of missed FS still resulting in target being cut in half if was previously hit with shuriken while both entities are airborne
